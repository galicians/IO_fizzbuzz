Coding the fizzbuzz kata in IO.

Io is a dynamic prototype-based programming language. 



IO is a language that is:

conceptually simple and consistent
easily embedded and extended
powerful
highly dynamic and introspective
highly concurrent (via coroutines and async i/o)
practical
fast enough
multi-platform
unrestrictive BSD/MIT license
comprehensive standard packages in distro


The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with prototyped languages before starting JavaScript.

To run this file, just install IO on your Mac, brew install io, or download the binaries from http://iolanguage.org/

After that just run io fizzbuzz.io from the directory where the file is placed.
